# Objectives
* Develop an ANN model to classify the 60 sonar readings to two classes, Rocks and Mines

# Dataset Information
- Obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
- Total of **208** sonar patterns were recorded:
    - 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various conditions.
    - 967 patters obtained from rocks under similar conditions.
- The data set contains signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90 degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock. However, actual aspect angles used for each pattern is unknown.
- Each pattern contains 60 sonar signals ranging from **0 to 1**. Each number represents energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time.
